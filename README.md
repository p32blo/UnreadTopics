# Unread Topics

This is a Google Chrome extension developed to try to help the users (including myself) of a SMF Forum.

The main feature is to automatically fetch and open the unread posts in different tabs.
In addition, users can upload images into their posts with a simple copy-paste.

At lunchtime, the canteen menu can also be consulted.
